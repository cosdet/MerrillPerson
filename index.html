            <p id="big-first-letter">In this project, we decided to focus on the concept of what it means to be in Merrill. As first years, we are welcomed into a community and put in a class without really knowing what we are getting ourselves into. The Merrill theme is <i>Cultural Identities and Global Consciousness.</i> We wanted to know how that theme is reflected into the values and teachings of Merrillites. We interviewed members of the Merrill staff and other Merrill students to answer our main question, “Who decides what Merrill stands for?” Through our research and interviews, we were able to explore and expand on our question and find more about what it means to be a Merrill student.</p>

                <p><b>Sean:</b> Are Merrill Affiliates chosen? If so, how?</p>
                <p><b>Aims:</b> The short answer is that when students are admitted here, and then they accept admission, then they have an opportunity to choose their college. But most students, interestingly, don't actually choose. They may not even be aware that they have a choice. You know, it's at admissions time; a lot is going on in people's lives. They don't necessarily see that email. And so most students at UC Santa Cruz end up being assigned by a process that is in part, I think, if it's not an algorithm, it's similar to an algorithm. And the algorithm, I think, really focuses on demography, demographic characteristics, so they want to create roughly comparable diversity in each college, as I just shared with you. Actually, it doesn't work out exactly that way since Merrill and Oakes are more diverse than the other colleges so there you are. So even though most Merrill affiliates are not here because they wanted to be here from the start, one thing I find, though, is that very quickly—certainly by the time people graduate—people do feel a sense of connection here at Merrill that is distinct and in some ways, arguably, I think, stronger than what you find in many other colleges.</p>
                <p>When students ask me about the theme, they often are kind of skeptical of it. It sounds like a brand name, something that could be on a cereal box. But then, when I asked students, like last year, when they were graduating, is the theme meaningful to you? And they were saying, “Yeah, actually it is,” and it became meaningful through the core course, it became meaningful even more with the interactions with other Merrill students. And they really did, actually, they imbued it with meaning. And partly, it's the space of the college; I find it so beautiful. There's this enclosed space around the Merrill lawn, there are nice places to hang out in the sun, at Cowell, at Porter, and other colleges, but there's something special about this lawn, especially like right now. For instance, I am very sad and stressed and very exhausted because of recent events, and I love just being here on the lawn and being here with the Merrill Chihuahua, seeing students hang out [...] So I find this kind of like, it feels kind of sheltered here, and I’m ever surrounded by the redwoods. I think that’s really, really beautiful.</p>
                <p>And weirdly, some of it is partly our altitude. This is something that students complain about, you know, like “I have to, I have to go up that hill.” And I feel that when I'm late for a meeting and I'm like, going up that inaccessible staircase, which is too thin; I’m thinking like, “Man, I wish that I did. Wish I didn't have to come up this hill.” But an interesting other effect of this hill is that once you do get up here, it feels like I made it. It can feel kind of like an oasis to me and the lawn can feel that way. And I mean, many students tell me, you know, I've had experiences like with [my friends] in Porter or Cowell or Stevenson, I say, “Let's hang out at Merrill”, and they're like, “No, it's like, too hard to get up there”, and that can hurt people's feelings. On the other hand, maybe that's okay, you know, if some people don't want to make the effort to come here to be on the Merrill lawn. No judgment there. You know, they get to make their own choices. And it gives us, in an interesting way, a kind of sense of maybe some of the benefits of exclusiveness without actually excluding, because everybody is welcome to come up to the hill, right? But not everybody makes the effort. And so it does mean that, yeah. So I think that creates a sense of a kind of intimacy and community here that allows students, from what they tell me, they really treasure.</p>
                <p><b>Eli:</b> What amount of influence do you have on the Core Course?</p>
                <p><b>Aims:</b> As the provost, my title is the chief academic officer of the college; so ultimately, I am responsible for the content of the core course and for hiring the instructors and leading the faculty and shaping the course in different ways. Well, I just started as provost, so this is only my second year. What happened last year was basically [that] I was new here, and I thought, well, let's just go with what we've been doing. Many students find the course meaningful, and instructors are enjoying the course, and so let's just leave things as they are. And then, you know, as I spoke to students, however, over the course of the year, I came to learn that lessons wanted the core course to be different, or they weren't connecting to it. They weren't finding it meaningful. And so I spoke about this with Merrill Student Government, and I asked Merrill Student Government, “What do you think? What do you think the core course should be?”. So I started just going to the Merrill Student Government meetings and getting people's opinions. And then we did surveys, and students actually really used their voice and said, “We like these things, but we don't like these other things.” And then, based on those surveys we hired four students to redesign the course over the summer based on surveys, research that they did, and others. So the course is actually much different this year than it was last year, in part because of our efforts to listen to students, and we'll be doing that again this year. So here are some examples of things that changed because of student demands or student concerns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Students last year and previous years liked the nature hikes. In many ways, it's just they like having a break from the classroom, and they like this is such a beautiful campus, it's cool to know things about it. But what students didn't like about it was all the hikes were over at Porter College, so they had to go across campus to them, and they also had to schedule it. It was two and a half hours and it was outside of class time. So that meant every student needed to find two and a half hours over the course of their quarter to walk over a quarter on a weekday, and that just felt like that's too much to ask of us. So we said, “okay”, we listened to that. And so now all the nature hikes are around Merrill, and they're very focused on Merrill, which is something that students wanted; and actually the environment, the ecology around Merrill, is different from Porter College. They have much more coastal prairie, where we have more of a conifer environment and so and now it happens within, within, within the section. So we don't ask anybody to change their schedule in order to do this.</li>
                    <li>Another thing: the Merrill Project, what you're doing right now is also a result of student demands. We had a previous project that was actually a project that many students found very meaningful, and it was about an event that took place in the late 1960s in the context of the Vietnam War, and a controversy over whether Hmong people in what's now Laos were being poisoned by US chemical weapons. And it's a really interesting and in many ways, kind of traumatic history, and students became very critical of that assignment. They pointed out that there actually were no Hmong voices and and and represented, and it was, and there wasn't a clear connection being made, actually, between the theme of Merrill College and the thing so a lot of students were experiencing it is kind of an interesting mystery story that was focused on the Hmong people, but in which Hmong people were not centered, and that didn't seem very narrow. So they were like, “Why don't we get rid of the assignment and do something better and that seems more meaningful to us, and that connects us to our own history?”. And actually, the Vietnam War is part of Merrill College's history, but in a different way. So that's where the Merrill Project kind of came about. So those are two examples where Merrill students were like, “No, we want this. We want this to be different.” So even though I am, as the provost, the chief academic officer, I try to do that job in a way that makes space for students to make the course their own.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And those are two examples of how it's changed, and I think it will change next year, depending [on what] you decide.</p>

            <h1>Interview #2: Merrill Alumni, Lucia Gomez</h1>
            <button class="dropdown-button open" onclick="drop(event, 'dia2')"></button>
            <div class="dialogue" id="dia2">
                <p><b>Heidi:</b> Um, hello, yes. Who am I with right now?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> Okay, my name is Lucia Gomez, and I graduated from UC Santa Cruz and Merrill College in June 2014.</p>
                <p><b>Heidi:</b> So your freshman year, did you guys have a Merrill core course?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> Yep, I took Merrill 80A. I believe it was Exploring Global Identities, or, sorry, Exploring Cultural Identities and Global Consciousness. That's what it was.</p>
                <p><b>Heidi:</b> Okay. Did you like your Merrill core course?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> I did. I, when I was in high school, I had taken, you know, English 9 through 12, and so going to university, and then being in a Merrill core class, writing class that was enhanced around the theme of cultural identities was something new. You always hear about culture shocks and what it means when you go to college, but then being able to learn about other people, other cultural identities was something new for me, and it was really exciting.</p>
                <p><b>Heidi:</b> That's interesting. What is one thing you've been able to take away from the core course?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> One thing I would say—I would've took many things, because the one thing that it pushed me to do was to study something that I became very quickly passionate about, which is sociology. I studied sociology, and I was able to very quickly focus on trends and impacts to our local and global communities, on topics that were like very perplexed, very on trend, but then also the topics like you wouldn't even consider or think about as often, right? Because we are in a very privileged society, so my education and my sociology passion started because of Merrill.</p>
                <p><b>Heidi:</b> Okay, that's cool. But since you did take something away, what are some changes you would want to see in the Merrill core course when you were there?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> Um, I don't know if you guys do this to this day, but if I remember correctly: The classroom for the Merrill core core class is very small and still hasn’t been updated, but I'm curious if you guys still do the movie screenings as part of the core class.</p>
                <p><b>Sean:</b> No, not anymore.</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> Okay, so, I even say, I feel like it's crazy to say this, but back in my day, right. When I was—when I was a student, I remember we used to have film be a part of the class. Every theme or topic or concept that we talked about, we watched a movie, and it was like all—all freshmen of Merrill were in the classroom 101, or the one over there by the bookstore. We used to have these movie screenings. Those were really great. But I thought that, like, one of the changes were to actually, like deep dive into those movies and discussions and talk about the impact that it has in Merrill or in our community, if I remember correctly, like we were watching them and then writing a paper on them, or writing some kind of reflection on them. But that was it.</p>
                <p><b>Sean:</b> I see, yeah, well, yeah, these movies don't seem to be in the core course today. So this is—this is interesting to hear.</p>
                <p><b>Heidi:</b> What's your favorite thing about Merrill, though?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> I was just there last year. Honestly, Merrill College is a vibe. I love that it is the highest place on campus and that it's a space that's really open to all. You have the Cantu center there, you have the radio station there. The views are great. But I also just feel like community at Merrill is big. I was a RA when I was there, I was a PA when I was there. Programs Assistant, Resident Assistant. I was able to build a meaningful connection to people at Merrill, so they helped me define and like re-establish family while I was away, and I still keep in touch with a lot of people from Merrill, like pretty close friends are some of my friends from Merrill College.</p>
                <p><b>Sean:</b> I’m glad you were able to make so many connections through Merrill. It seems like a large like thing that Merrill people feel nowadays is that it seems pretty distant and that we're kind of excluded from the rest of the campus because of our elevation. At the same time, I guess, yeah, that makes it so that you have your own little community up here, which is nice. Yeah, and I think you kind of answered this in your previous answers, but just to say it again, do you feel like you resonated or related to Merrill’s core value of Exploring Cultural Identities and Raising Global Consciousness?</p>
                <p><b>Lucia:</b> I feel like at first I didn't know what that truly meant, like I thought we were gonna get a generic, you know, exploring cultural identities. When I got there, it made me open my eyes to that culture shock that I mentioned earlier, and it made me really make an attempt to figure out and identify, like, where was my place in the world, and then with, you know, talking to my advisors at Merrill, like, talking to people at Merrill, like, I found that it's like, that's the whole point of you being at UCSC, is that you are there to figure out what you want, to study, what you are passionate about. And then back to the core class. And then, like, the core values, it's about figuring out who you are in this world and what your purpose is.</p>
