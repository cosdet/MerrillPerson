                <p><b>Interviewer:</b> Hello.</p>
                <p><b>Aims:</b> Hello.</p>
                <p><b>Eli:</b> What amount of influence do you have on the Core Course?</p>
                <p><b>Aims:</b> As the provost, my title is the chief academic officer of the college; so ultimately, I am responsible for the content of the core course and for hiring the instructors and leading the faculty and shaping the course in different ways. Well, I just started as provost, so this is only my second year. What happened last year was basically [that] I was new here, and I thought, well, let's just go with what we've been doing. Many students find the course meaningful, and instructors are enjoying the course, and so let's just leave things as they are. And then, you know, as I spoke to students, however, over the course of the year, I came to learn that lessons wanted the core course to be different, or they weren't connecting to it. They weren't finding it meaningful. And so I spoke about this with Merrill Student Government, and I asked Merrill Student Government, “What do you think? What do you think the core course should be?”. So I started just going to the Merrill Student Government meetings and getting people's opinions. And then we did surveys, and students actually really used their voice and said, “We like these things, but we don't like these other things.” And then, based on those surveys we hired four students to redesign the course over the summer based on surveys, research that they did, and others. So the course is actually much different this year than it was last year, in part because of our efforts to listen to students, and we'll be doing that again this year. So here are some examples of things that changed because of student demands or student concerns:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li style="margin-bottom: 40px;">Students last year and previous years liked the nature hikes. In many ways, it's just they like having a break from the classroom, and they like this is such a beautiful campus, it's cool to know things about it. But what students didn't like about it was all the hikes were over at Porter College, so they had to go across campus to them, and they also had to schedule it. It was two and a half hours and it was outside of class time. So that meant every student needed to find two and a half hours over the course of their quarter to walk over a quarter on a weekday, and that just felt like that's too much to ask of us. So we said, “okay”, we listened to that. And so now all the nature hikes are around Merrill, and they're very focused on Merrill, which is something that students wanted; and actually the environment, the ecology around Merrill, is different from Porter College. They have much more coastal prairie, where we have more of a conifer environment and so and now it happens within, within, within the section. So we don't ask anybody to change their schedule in order to do this.</li>
                    <li>Another thing: the Merrill Project, what you're doing right now is also a result of student demands. We had a previous project that was actually a project that many students found very meaningful, and it was about an event that took place in the late 1960s in the context of the Vietnam War, and a controversy over whether Hmong people in what's now Laos were being poisoned by US chemical weapons. And it's a really interesting and in many ways, kind of traumatic history, and students became very critical of that assignment. They pointed out that there actually were no Hmong voices and and and represented, and it was, and there wasn't a clear connection being made, actually, between the theme of Merrill College and the thing so a lot of students were experiencing it is kind of an interesting mystery story that was focused on the Hmong people, but in which Hmong people were not centered, and that didn't seem very narrow. So they were like, “Why don't we get rid of the assignment and do something better and that seems more meaningful to us, and that connects us to our own history?”. And actually, the Vietnam War is part of Merrill College's history, but in a different way. So that's where the Merrill Project kind of came about. So those are two examples where Merrill students were like, “No, we want this. We want this to be different.” So even though I am, as the provost, the chief academic officer, I try to do that job in a way that makes space for students to make the course their own.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>And those are two examples of how it's changed, and I think it will change next year, depending [on what] you decide.</p>
